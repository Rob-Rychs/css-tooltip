# Pure CSS Tooltips

[demo](http://harrygfox.github.io/css-tooltip)

`tooltip.css` contains all of the styles that create the tooltips. 

This technique makes use of the `attr()` function. This means that all of the content is in the markup and so the stylesheet is modular and reusable. 

In this example the stylesheet is only activated above a breakpoint of 767px.
